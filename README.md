When setting up classes that need archiving (NSCoding), entering property information 2 or more times over becomes tedious real quick. Here's a script that will print out the encoding, decoding, and initialization details for you. You can then copy and paste these lines straight into your code and be on your way.

# Requirements
 • Just have your properties ready. They'll need to be on one line (no line returns -- I just copy and paste mine into a search bar then copy it again).
 • I have a semi-specific format layed out in the script. Should be easy enough to modify the file to your style/needs.
